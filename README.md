# SmartCarParking-Android-App
In this app I used the firebase real-time database, Zxing QR code api and SQLite database. The motive of this project is to we can maintain the real-time parking information from the QR code. So when users firstly install the app. The app fills the car owner information (car plate name, car owner name, phone no, home address) using the various android widget and generate a QR code for particular user which has a unique id and store this QR code in SQLite database. And this same ID are also store in the firebase database in the form of one node which having all owner information. When user enter in the car parking area the parking maintainer guy just scan the QR code and fetch the car owner information from the firebase database and make a another node for real-time car parking and also store the timing. When user exit the car parking .The parking maintainer guy scan the user QR code and charge the money according to the difference of enter and exit time of parking.
